#CONTENT
##  THE THINGS I HAVE ADDED AND CHANGED.

- I have refactored the website by replacing static content with dynamic content managed through a custom-built admin panel. This admin panel includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing me to easily add, edit, or remove works directly from the backend without modifying code. Additionally, I reorganized the site structure by splitting content into modular sections across different pages for better navigation and scalability. Each work entry now also has its own dedicated page, making it easier to showcase individual projects with more detail.
- THE SEO IMPLEMENTATION STAYS THE SAME.
