#CONTENT
##  THE THINGS I HAVE ADDED AND CHANGED.

-General 

I have refactored the website by replacing static content with dynamic content managed through a custom-built admin panel. This admin panel includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing me to easily add, edit, or remove works directly from the backend without modifying code. Additionally, I reorganized the site structure by splitting content into modular sections across different pages for better navigation and scalability. Each work entry now also has its own dedicated page, making it easier to showcase individual projects with more detail.
- THE SEO IMPLEMENTATION STAYS THE SAME.

##  MAIN PAGE.
-Hero Section:

The top section of the page features:
My personal image (professional photo).
A brief introduction with my name and profession:
"Web Developer" as the main title or subtitle.
This section is designed to give visitors an immediate idea of who I am and what I do.

-About Me / Description Section:

A short personal description about who I am.
Details about what I do, including:
My experience in web development.
Technologies I enjoy working with.

-Education Section

The final section of the main page displays my educational background:
University degrees or formal studies.
