	text: `As part of my HNC in Web and Software Development at Edinburgh College, I embarked on another exciting project: creating the "Bike Kings Border" website, a site dedicated to showcasing and selling bikes. This project was a great opportunity to apply the skills I had honed from completing JavaScript and React courses on Udemy, further solidifying my understanding and proficiency in web development. <br><br>
	For the "Bike Kings Border" website, I focused on creating a dynamic and interactive experience using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I built an array of bike objects, each containing various properties such as name, type, price, and availability. Leveraging JavaScript's forEach method, I looped through these objects to render them dynamically into an HTML container, ensuring that the product listings were both comprehensive and easy to navigate. <br><br>
	One of the key features of the site was the product search functionality. To implement this, I used the filter method in JavaScript, allowing users to search for bikes based on specific criteria such as type or price range. This method efficiently filtered the array of bike objects, updating the displayed products in real-time as users entered their search parameters. <br><br>
	In addition to the search functionality, I created all animations and interactive features myself using vanilla JavaScript. This included smooth transitions, hover effects, and dynamic content updates that enhanced the overall user experience. The forEach method was instrumental in rendering the filtered results back into the HTML container. By looping through the filtered array, I dynamically updated the product listings, providing a seamless and responsive user experience. <br><br>
	By this point, I had also improved my design skills significantly, reaching a level I was satisfied with. I was able to replicate any design from scratch with precision and attention to detail, ensuring a polished and professional look. <br><br>
	Overall, the "Bike Kings Border" website was a testament to my growing expertise in frontend development. It showcased my ability to create interactive, data-driven web applications from scratch. The knowledge gained from my Udemy courses on JavaScript and React was invaluable, enabling me to tackle this project with confidence and precision. This website, much like the "Organic Me" project, marked another significant step in my web development journey. <br><br>

Despite its simplicity, it provided a valuable learning experience as I delved into PHP and SQL to create a functional and dynamic website. <br> <br>
	One of the key features of the website was user registration functionality, powered by PHP and integrated with an online SQL database. <br> <br>
	To populate the website with products, I utilized PHP to fetch data from the SQL database and dynamically render product listings. This ensured that the website could easily scale with the addition of new products or changes to existing ones. <br> <br>
	While the website's functionality was the primary focus, I also incorporated elements of design and interactivity. Leveraging my skills in JavaScript, I implemented custom animations and modal windows from scratch, enhancing the user experience and adding a touch of flair to the site. <br> <br>
	Though it was a simple project, creating this candle shop website was a rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of PHP, SQL, and JavaScript in a real-world scenario, while also honing my skills in web development and design.

	During my learning journey with a React course, I was inspired to create a small yet practical application that would simplify the process of splitting costs between friends and managing shared expenses.

Users could add individuals to their accounts, assign expenses to each person, and track the overall balance owed or owed to them. The intuitive user interface facilitated smooth navigation and ensured a hassle-free experience. . <br> <br>
	To enhance the functionality of the application, I integrated PHP with Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, to handle server-side operations. This included saving user profiles and expense data to an SQL database, enabling persistent storage and seamless access to information across sessions. . <br> <br>
	By combining React for the frontend and PHP with Axios for the backend, I created a robust and versatile application that streamlined expense management and fostered collaborative financial planning among users.

	Learning the useReducer hook in React has been a transformative journey in enhancing my development skills. Recently, I embarked on a project to create a simple quiz application that not only challenged my understanding of React but also allowed me to integrate various advanced features. <br><br>
	The primary feature of my quiz application is a timer that limits the duration each user has to complete the quiz. Implementing this required a deep dive into the useReducer hook to manage the complex state logic needed for the quiz's flow. Using useReducer, I was able to efficiently handle the state transitions for starting the quiz, updating the timer, and processing the user's answers. <br><br>
	To make the quiz dynamic and engaging, I decided to fetch questions from a Web API hosted on my server. This is where the useEffect hook came into play. By leveraging useEffect, I could fetch the questions asynchronously when the component mounts, ensuring that the latest set of questions is rendered each time the quiz starts. This asynchronous fetching not only improved the user experience but also allowed me to work with real-world data, making the application more robust and scalable. <br><br>
	Throughout this process, I've seen a significant improvement in my React skills. The combination of useReducer and useEffect has empowered me to manage complex state and side effects seamlessly. This project has not only expanded my technical capabilities but also deepened my understanding of React's powerful hooks. <br><br>
	In conclusion, building this quiz application has been a rewarding experience. It has allowed me to put theory into practice, enhance my problem-solving skills, and produce a functional and interactive application. I look forward to continuing my journey with React and exploring even more advanced concepts in the future. <br><br>
